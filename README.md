This repository contains a simple Python script demonstrating a common coding error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The bug.py file shows the code with the error, and the bugSolution.py file shows the corrected version.  The error results in a SyntaxError during compilation.  This example highlights the importance of carefully checking for matching parentheses when writing Python code.
